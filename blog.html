	<h4>May 26<sup>th</sup>, 2021</h4>
	<p>It's <em>day 3</em> of me learning html, and I am genuinely excited to now know how to add pictures (excitement specifically for GIFs) and tables to documents!</p>
	<p>For context, this is what I have learnt so far:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The history and evolution of html
			<ul>
				<li><i>Day 1 was more of a history than hands-on coding lesson.</i></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How to create a file (I know, impressive.)</li>
		<li>The semantics of html</li>
		<li>Stylistic text elements</li>
		<li>Structurally-based elements</li>
		<li>Hyperlinks
			<ul>
				<li>Absolute v. relative paths</li>
				<li>Linking to email addresses</li>
				<li>Opening links to a new window</li>
				<li>Linking to specific parts of the same page</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How to create and nest lists (obviously...)
			<ul>
				<li>Ordered lists</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Start attribute</li>
						<li>Reversed attribute</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Unordered lists</li>
				<li>Descriptive lists</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Well, that's a lot; I definitely missed some things too. It's funny how easy it is to cognitively minimize large quantities. Then you write them down and are forced to accept their real value. &#129335;</p>
	<p>In honor of learning how to make a table (and despite not having any meaningful information to add to a table), I am making a table. Enjoy :)</p>
<p>
	<table border="1">
		<caption><strong>A Table, Because I Can</strong> &#128548;</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">HTML element/concept</th>
				<th scope="col">Useful?</th>
				<th scope="col">Enjoyable?</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Tables</td>
				<td>Personally, not so much.</td>
				<td>Not mad about it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Semantics</td>
				<td>Definitely.</td>
				<td>Not at all.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Hyperlinks</td>
				<td>Majorly.</td>
				<td>I would gladly code hyperlinks all day.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
		<tfoot>
			<tr>
				<td>This is purely to practice the semantics of using a table foot.</td>
				<td>There is no logical information to place here.</td>

	<h4>May 27<sup>th</sup>, 2021</h4>
	<p>Today I learnt more tags and attributes. I mainly learnt semantic elements (like figure) and attributes, like how to add figure captions or resize images with pixel values or percentages.
	<br>Otherwise, I'm feeling antsy about coding; I want to design beautiful pages, and I am very much over the black and white, disgustingly stylistically lacking browser displays of my code thus far.
	I've been debating whether or not to jump into CSS (because I know that's where a lot of the style comes into play), but I think it's best to become fluent with html first.
	<p>I also learnt how to add <em>favicons</em> to my files, tiny details that have an underated power to make documents appear way more credible.</p>
	<p><strong>Here is the first favicon I added:</strong>
	<br><small>(I expect by the time I publish this website, it would have been changed many times):</small></p>
	<img src="https://freepngimg.com/download/heart/28-red-heart-png-image-download.png" width="10%" alt="red heart">
	<p>I initially wanted my favicon to be the star-eyed emoji, but after multiple seemingly-failed attempts at adding it (aka until I realized the favicon would only appear in Chrome, not Safari), I went with the heart.</p>

	<h4>May 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021</h4>
	<p>Today I continued on with the Coursera videos, which I now find a bit redundant since I did all of the assigned Shay Howe readings beforehand.
	One thing the professor does stress that is not included in the readings is the importance of <em>accessibility</em> when coding.
	She frequently references how some people use screenreaders and how critical it is to keep them in mind. For example, screenreaders cannot always read images or icons, 
	which is why one should be careful when creating <b>graphic hyperlinks</b> and be sure to include good <em>alt text</em>.</p>
	<p>The professor's emphasis on accessibility very much resonates with me, for it reflects my <em>family science</em> (aka public health) background and value of <a href="intention.html" target="_blank">empathy</a>.
	The more I learn about and practice html, the more I appreciate its linguistic nature. While the semantics were annoying at first, they're growing on me.
	Html really is a beautiful thing.</p>
	<p>I also learnt how to source from <a href="http://www.fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> and use multimedia tags today (i.e. how to add audio and video to pages). 
	In honor of the latter, enjoy the following song (that has been my go-to replay as of late):</p>
	<audio src="file:///Users/gabadmin/Desktop/HTML5/Coursera%20Files/Still-Woozy_Kenny.mp3" controls></audio>

	<h4>May 29<sup>th</sup></h4>
	<p>Tonight I learned some (what the Coursera professor called) <em>useful</em> tags, a few of which require <em>JavaScript</em> to work, but nevertheless useful.</p>
	<p><strong>Some of my favorites include</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>&lt;details&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;progress&gt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></li>
		<li><code>&lt;code&gt;</code> (obviously)</li>
	</ul>
	<p><code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> both require JavaScript to work, which marks a strengthened commitment of mine to learnt both CSS and JavaScript.
	As an artist (and like I've mentioned before), html is painfully bland, and I know CSS is what will enable me to create the aesthetic I envision by cannot yet manifest.
	JavaScript seems to be important as a metadata-ish device, something that is not technically seen but influences the functionality of seen elements. (<em>Disclaimer</em>:
	I know absolutely nothing about JavaScript and internally feel that assessment being incorrect, but this is a reflection, isn't it?)</p>
	<p>At this point, I feel that I pretty much know html. Am I an expert? Of course not. But even by <a href="#may26">day 3</a>, when I knew how to create webpages and 
	basic semantic and stylistic elements, I was pretty much set. It seems like html is the kind of language you continuously learn via practice and researching tags when necessary.
	The Coursera professor herself said it was impossible for her to teach us all the tags, and in the future, you just look up the ones you need but not yet know.
	Just like any other language, I'll continue learning new &#8220;words,&#8221; &#8220;grammar,&#8221; and &#8220;literary devices&#8221; along the way.</p>
	<p>What a productive week it has been.</p>
