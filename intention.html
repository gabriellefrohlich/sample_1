<h1>Intention</h1>
<p>When creating anything, whether it be a piece of art, document, or relationship, it is important to be able to communicate the <em>purpose</em> of your actions.
Ultimately, effective communication fosters <em>trust</em>; it proves you to be reliable in achieving results and purposeful in your efforts.
To be an intentional person requires more than introspective understanding; it requires a comprehensive understanding of others: <b>empathy</b>.</p>
<section>
	<h3>Empathy: a Neglected Asset</h3>
	<p>As an empath, I find understanding others' and communicating my own emotions critical to interpersonal cohesion and harmony and creating the best possible products and services.
	Working so that <em>others</em>, not only myself, may succeed is an overarching value of mine that drives my behaviors and intentions. Consequently, empathy is a tool I frequently (if not constantly) apply to both personal and professional endeavors.</br> 
	<br>Empathizing is critical for:
		<ul>
			<li>collaboration</li>
			<li>conflict management</li>
			<li>purposeful planning of key activities</li>
			<li>impact achievement</li>
			<li>personal and professional satisfaction</li>
		</ul>
	among numerous other indicators of succesful work.</br></p>
	<h3>Design Thinking: Exemplifying Empathy's Foundational Functions</h3>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process" target="__blank">design thinking process</a>
	inherently evidences empathy's power to achieve impactful results.</br>
	<br><strong>The 5 Design Thinking Steps Are:</strong></br>
		<ol>
			<li>Empathize</li>
			<li>Define</li>
			<li>Ideate</li>
			<li>Prototype</li>
			<li>Test</li>
		</ol>
	<p>The stages may be called different names (depending on the source), but all begin with empathizing as a means of understanding the needs and desires of your intended beneficiaries.</br>
	<br>Neglected to immerse oneself in an empathetic state results in the creation of self-serving products and services that fail to fill the gaps in your market of interest.
	It can result in a waste of resources, whether that be time, energy, money, or human capital, and is counterintuitive to the purpose of design.
	We design to build better futures, to serve those in need and patch societal gaps; the individual does not represent humanity, and as such, one must research via empathizing to best educate oneself of how to truly manifest sustainable, <em>needed</em> change.</br></p>
