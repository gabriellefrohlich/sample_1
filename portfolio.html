	<h2>Dedicated to the language of html</h2>
	<p>Learning how to code in html is more than creating webpages and displays for browsers; it includes communicating meaning and intention to those viewing your code.</p>

	<h2>How I learnt HTML5</h2>	
	<h3>Coding Goals</h3>
	<h4>What I Hoped For and Envisioned</h4>
	<p>Html is a pretty straight-forward language; it is in English and explicit in its intention.
	The most confusing elements are the semantic ones; features that visually appear the same on the browser (or are not displayed at all, like structural elements) that have important intention and distinctive purpose.
	My hope is to concretely grasp these topics and be able to code neat, organized, purposeful code.</br>
	<br>Further, as an artist (and kind of aspiring UX designer), aesthetic is important to me.
	I hope to be able to design beautiful interfaces, one's with color, images, shapes, various fonts, columns, and more.
	I especially want to be able to create dynamic pages, or <b>product motion design</b>, as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwipxa-SxufwAhWFTDABHb6LALcQFjACegQIAhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fpayton-meyer-1493061b&usg=AOvVaw0uwH_nTPhoSA_VNnaxeOVo" target="_blank">Payton Meyer</a> advised.</br></p> 
	<p><strong>Thoughts on dynamic design:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>I reached out to Payton via LinkedIn, and after speaking to him about UX design and discussing my concerns and hopes for the field, I decided I would 100% learn html and 90% pursue UX design.</li>
		<li>Besides the fact that UI animation is an awesome bonus skill, I have always loved animate (and taught myself how to do very novice character and graphic animation), so I was determined to learn that too.</li>
	</ul>
	I just want to create. Art is creation, but above all, <em>communication</em>. Through learning how to communicate via html, I will be able to evolve into a strong, effective creator.</p>

	<h3>HTML5 Progress</h3>
	<p>When I want to do something, I entirely dedicate myself to doing so.</br>
	<br>After a little over a day (beginning on 05/24/21) of learning html from Coursera and (mostly) <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank">Shay Howe</a>, I went from creating a file with three lines to a four paged website.
	<a href="blog.html">Read my blog</a> to see my progress as I learnt and practiced new html elements.</br>
	<br><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I hope you love GIFs as much as I do... and emojis. Both <em>will</em> be making frequent appearances! &#128521;</br></p>
